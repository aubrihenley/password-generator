# password-generator

This project was to create a random password generator using javascript. The generator should ask for an input value for the lenght of the password and then bring up corresponding prompts for the type of characters to use within the password(ex. Uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols). Once at least one attribute has been selected the password will be printed to the screen when the user clicks on the generate password button.
